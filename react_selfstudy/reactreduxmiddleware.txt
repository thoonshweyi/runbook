One-line idea

Redux middleware is just a function that runs BEFORE the action reaches the reducer.

That’s it.

Think like this 🧠

When you do:

dispatch(action)


Redux does not send the action directly to the reducer.

Instead, it goes like this:

dispatch(action)
   ↓
middleware
   ↓
reducer


Middleware is just a stop in the middle.

Why middleware exists (very simple)

Reducers:

❌ cannot call API

❌ cannot wait (async)

❌ cannot log

Middleware:

✅ API calls

✅ async

✅ logging

✅ checking conditions

The scary line (made friendly)
store => next => action =>


Ignore the arrows for a second.

It really means:

middleware(store, next, action)


Redux just passes them one by one.

What each word means (plain English)
store

Gives you:

getState()

dispatch()

👉 “What is the current state?”

action

This is what you dispatched:

dispatch({ type: "ADD" });


👉 Middleware sees the action first

next

A function that says:

“Ok, send this action forward”

next(action)


If you don’t call next, reducer will never run.

Smallest middleware example
const simpleMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  console.log("Action:", action);
  next(action);
};


What happens?

You dispatch action

Middleware logs it

Action continues to reducer

What if you DON’T call next(action)?
const blockMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  if (action.type === "DELETE") return;
  next(action);
};


👉 Action is stopped
👉 Reducer never sees it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: It is NOT one function

It is 3 functions, inside each other.

store => next => action => {
  // code
}


means:

function first(store) {
  return function second(next) {
    return function third(action) {
      // code
    };
  };
}


That’s it. Nothing more.

Step 2: Why 3 functions?

Because Redux gives values in 3 moments:

Moment	Redux gives
Store created	store
Middleware setup	next
Every dispatch	action
Step 3: Think of it like this (VERY IMPORTANT)
Imagine a factory
1️⃣ Factory setup time (once)
middleware(store)


Now middleware knows the store forever.

2️⃣ Assembly line setup (once)
middleware(store)(next)


Now middleware knows where to send the action next.

3️⃣ Product arrives (many times)
middleware(store)(next)(action)


Now middleware handles each action.

Step 4: Visual flow
store creation
   ↓
store => (saved)

middleware chain setup
   ↓
next => (saved)

dispatch happens
   ↓
action => (used)

Step 5: Very concrete example (no Redux)
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return function(c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

add(1)(2)(3); // 6


Same pattern. Just numbers instead of Redux.

Step 6: Back to Redux (simple words)
const middleware = store => next => action => {
  console.log(action);
  next(action);
};
