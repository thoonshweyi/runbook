✅ Why this works (short explanation)

An .xlsx file is just a ZIP file that contains many folders and XML files.
Excel hides this from normal users.

Inside that ZIP file, all embedded images are stored in one place.

🪜 Step-by-Step: How to get images from Excel (xl/media)
🔹 Step 1: Make a copy of the Excel file

👉 Important: Do NOT work on the original file

Example:

product_list.xlsx


Copy it and rename:

product_list_copy.xlsx

🔹 Step 2: Rename .xlsx → .zip

Right-click the copied file

Rename:

product_list_copy.xlsx
↓
product_list_copy.zip


If Windows asks:

“Are you sure you want to change the file extension?”

👉 Click Yes

🔹 Step 3: Extract the ZIP file

Right-click product_list_copy.zip

Click Extract All

Click Extract

Now you will see a folder like:

product_list_copy/

🔹 Step 4: Navigate to images folder

Open folders in this exact order:

product_list_copy
 └── xl
     └── media


📂 Path

product_list_copy/xl/media/

🎉 Step 5: Get your images

Inside media folder you will see:

image1.png
image2.jpeg
image3.jpg
